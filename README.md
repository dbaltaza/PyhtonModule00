# Python Module 00

> **42 School Project - Python Module 00**  
> Learn the basics of Python through practical exercises and clear concepts.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains solutions and resources for **Python Module 00**, the first step in the 42 School Python curriculum. The module covers fundamental Python concepts, introducing you to the language’s syntax, variable management, control structures, and essential built-in functions—everything you need to get started with Python programming.

---

## 📝 Project Objectives

- Understand Python syntax and indentation
- Work with variables, strings, and numbers
- Use lists, tuples, and basic data structures
- Write and call functions
- Implement control flow: if, for, while
- Practice reading and writing to files

Each folder (`ex00`, `ex01`, etc.) features an independent exercise or small project designed to help solidify the corresponding topic.

## 🚦 Usage

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dbaltaza/PyhtonModule00.git
   cd PyhtonModule00
   ```
2. **Run the exercises**
   - Each exercise includes a `.py` file with the function to test.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python exXX/<filename>.py
     ```

## 📚 General Instructions

- Your functions must be written in **Python 3.10+**.
- Your code **must respect [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) linter standards**.
- Each exercise must be in its **own file**.
- Each file should contain **only the requested function**.
- Function names must **match exactly** what is requested.
- You do **not** need to handle input validation or error cases unless **explicitly mentioned**.
- For negative numbers or invalid inputs, the behavior is **undefined** (you don’t need to handle these cases).
- **Type hints** are optional but recommended for learning purposes (will be introduced in Exercise 7).

> **Growing Code Specific Note:**  
> Since this is an introductory project focusing on basic Python syntax, you only need to submit your individual Python function files (e.g., `ft_hello_garden.py`, `ft_plot_area.py`, etc.). Advanced project management tools will be introduced in later projects.

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A code editor (**vim** or **emacs** recommended by 42 style)
- Respect 42 formatting and file naming guidelines

---

## 🔍 Evaluation

- Strict adherence to the 42 school [Norme](https://github.com/42School/norme) (adapted for Python).
- **Code must comply with [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) linter standards.**
- No unauthorized modules or external libraries.
- Each exercise is self-contained and executable.

---

## 💡 Tips

- Write **clear**, **concise**, and **well-commented** code.
- Check edge cases.
- Read the subject files carefully.
- Use **PEP8** guidelines for code style.
- Run `flake8` on your files to check code style before submitting.
